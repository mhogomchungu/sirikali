Below are instructions on how to build SiriKali on OSX.

1.  Clone SiriKali repository with the following command:
    "git clone https://github.com/mhogomchungu/sirikali.git"
    When you run git the first time on macOS, you will be
    prompted to install developer tools (which includes git) and be guided through it.
2.  Install homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
3.  Install dependencies with brew:
3.1 brew install libgcrypt
3.2 brew install qt5
3.3 brew install pkg-config
3.4 brew install cmake

4.  brew cask install osxfuse
    # for encfs support
5.1 brew install encfs
    # for securefs support
5.2 brew install securefs
    # for gocryptfs support
5.3 brew install gocryptfs

    # Inside the directory of the cloned repository
6.  mkdir build
7.  cd build
    # You need to specify the path to the qt5 you installed through homebrew:
8.  export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/
    # Then you'll be able to compile Sirikali to $HOME/sirikali
9.  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sirikali -DQT5=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..
	# Compile using all available logical cores
10. make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
11. make install
12. "install" SiriKali by just dragging it (in the Finder) from the directory you
    compiled it in to the "Application" directory.

*****************************************************************************************************

available build options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sirikali
This option tells the build process to install project's files in "$HOME/sirikali".

This option tells the build process to build the project in release mode.This mode is most suitable for non developers.

-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false
This option tells the build process to add gnome's libsecret secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if
you do not want libsecret's support.

-DINTERNAL_LXQT_WALLET=false
This project depends on lxqt_wallet project and it ships with an internal copy of the project. Set this option to "true"
if you want SiriKali to unconditionally use the internal copy of the project or to "false" to make the build process
use a system installed version if found.
