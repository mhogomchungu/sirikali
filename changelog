version 1.0.0
-- Initial release.
-- Can create and unlock Cryfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Encfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Gocryptfs Volumes.
-- Can create and unlock Securefs Volumes.
-- Can save and retrieve volumes keys from KDE wallet,GNOME's libsecret and an internal
   secured storage system backed by libgcrypt.
-- Can save favorite volumes for easier access to frequently used volumes.
-- Can use keys derived from passphrases,keyfiles and a combination of a passphrase and a keyfile.
-- Can be build with Qt4(default) or with Qt5.
-- Can measure password strength when creating a new volume.
   The support is added using libpwquality project: https://fedorahosted.org/libpwquality/

-- Add ability to unmount all volumes at the same time(Menu->UnmountAll)
-- Add ability to generate mounting dialog with a single action(Menu->Favorites->Mount All)

-- Add French translations.

-- Add ability to auto unlock a volume from CLI.An example of how to do this is:

   sirikali -d /home/mtz/cryfs.volume -b "internal"

   The "-b" option gives a passphrase storage backend to use to retrieve the password to unlock
   the volume. Currently,only 3 backends are supported:
   1. "internal" backend is always there and its backed by libgcrypt.
   2. "kwallet" is backed by KDE wallet is a compile time dependency of the project.
   3. "gnomewallet" is backed by GNOME's libsecret and is a compile time dependency of the project.

   Set the backend to use a blank passphrase(not recommended) if you want to be able to unlock
   your volumes without being prompt for a backend password.

-- Add support for unlocking volumes using an external config file.
-- Add a GUI ability to show cryfs file system space utilization.
-- Add a menu entry to set default mount point path prefix.
-- Add a convenient "HMAC+KeyFile" option to use a keyfile with an empty passphrase
   as a volume password. "Key+KeyFile" option is to be used if volume passphrase is to be a combination
   of a password and a keyfile. Both of these two options are better than using a "KeyFile" option
   because keyfiles will most likely be trancated on the first new line character encountered and al the
   contents of the keyfile may not be used leading to weak passphrase.
