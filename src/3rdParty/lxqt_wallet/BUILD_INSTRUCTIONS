The build system in use is cmake

To build make sure you have the following packages installed(packages may be named differently in your distribution):

g++
gcc
cmake
libsecret-devel( if you want to add libsecret support )
KF5Wallet-devel( if you want to add KDE/Kwallet support )
Qt5Widgets-devel, Qt5Core-devel and Qt5LinguistTools

Build instructions are below:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DNOKDESUPPORT=false -DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
make install

meaning for different options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
This options tells the build system the root folder of where to install files.

-DNOKDESUPPORT=false
This option adds support for KDE's kwallet.
Change the option to "true" if you do not want kwallet support.

-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=false
This option adds support for GNOME's libsecret.
Change the option to "true" if you do not want libsecret support.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
This option builds the project in release mode.
Consult cmake documentation for other options.
