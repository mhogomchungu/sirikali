This project seeks to give a functionality for secure storage of information that can be presented in key-pair values
like user names-passwords.

Currently the project can store the information in KDE's kwallet,GNOME's secret service or in an internal system.

The internal secure storage system allows the functionality to be provided without dependencies on KDE or gnome libraries.

The header file with the public API is named "lxqt_wallet.h".

This project is designed to be used by other projects simply by adding the source folder in the build system and start using it.

The front end is build on Qt/C++ and has an optional dependency on KDE's kwallet and GNOME's secretservice.

The project allows other Qt based project's to target one API and use it for secure storage of information in different
secure storage systems.
